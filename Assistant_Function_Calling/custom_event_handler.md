This Python code defines a custom event handler for OpenAI's AssistantEventHandler, designed to handle specific events in an asynchronous chat-like environment. The main goal is to process `thread.run.requires_action` events and handle tool calls required by the assistant.

### **Key Components**

#### 1. **Class: `EventHandler`**
   - **Inheritance:** Inherits from `AssistantEventHandler` (likely from OpenAI's SDK).
   - **Purpose:** Handles events generated during the assistant's execution.

---

#### 2. **Method: `on_event(self, event)`**
   - **Input:** 
     - `event`: Represents an event generated by the assistant (e.g., tool calls or other significant actions).
   - **Logic:** 
     - Checks if the event type is `thread.run.requires_action`. 
     - If true, it retrieves the `run_id` from the event's data and delegates processing to `handle_requires_action`.

---

#### 3. **Method: `handle_requires_action(self, data, run_id)`**
   - **Purpose:** Processes tool calls that require specific outputs.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Initializes an empty list, `tool_outputs`, to collect results.
     2. Iterates through `data.required_action.submit_tool_outputs.tool_calls`:
        - Identifies tool calls by their function name (`tool.function.name`).
        - For example:
          - If the tool is named `get_current_temperature`, it appends a hardcoded response `"57"` (likely degrees).
          - If the tool is `get_rain_probability`, it appends `"0.06"` (a 6% chance).
     3. Calls `submit_tool_outputs` to send these responses back to the assistant.

---

#### 4. **Method: `submit_tool_outputs(self, tool_outputs, run_id)`**
   - **Purpose:** Submits the tool call outputs.
   - **Steps:**
     - Uses `submit_tool_outputs_stream`, a streaming function from the OpenAI SDK, to send responses (`tool_outputs`) to the assistant in the context of the current thread and run.
     - As the streaming happens, it listens for text deltas (interim output text) and prints them to the console.

---

#### 5. **Streaming with `client.beta.threads.runs.stream()`**
   - **Purpose:** Begins a streaming session for the assistant.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `thread_id`: The ID of the current thread.
     - `assistant_id`: The ID of the assistant.
     - `event_handler`: An instance of `EventHandler`, which processes events in real time.
   - **Behavior:** The streaming continues until all events are processed (via `stream.until_done()`).

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. **Event Generation:**
   - An event, `thread.run.requires_action`, is generated by the assistant because it requires tool outputs.
2. **Event Handling:**
   - The `on_event` method processes the event, retrieves its `run_id`, and passes it to `handle_requires_action`.
3. **Processing Tool Calls:**
   - The `handle_requires_action` method matches tool calls (e.g., `get_current_temperature`) and assigns appropriate outputs.
4. **Submitting Outputs:**
   - The `submit_tool_outputs` method streams the outputs back to the assistant.
5. **Streaming Session:**
   - The `EventHandler` ensures all tool calls and events are processed and outputs are submitted.

### **Example Scenarios**

#### Scenario 1: Parameters Available
**User Query**:  
*"What's the temperature in Tokyo?"*

**Assistant Behavior**:
- Extracts "Tokyo" as the parameter for the `get_current_temperature` function.
- Calls the function directly and responds with the result.

---

#### Scenario 2: Missing Parameters
**User Query**:  
*"What's the temperature right now?"*

**Assistant Behavior**:
- Notices that the required `location` parameter is missing.
- Generates a tool call (e.g., `get_user_location`) to fetch the user's current location. (Since, location is required parameter to for the function `get_current_temperature`)
- Once the tool provides the location, it calls the `get_current_temperature` function and responds.

---

### **Conclusion**
The assistant operates in a dynamic, context-aware manner:
- It extracts parameters from user input whenever possible. User input can be query, assistant memory or vector store. 
- It uses tools to gather missing parameters if necessary.

This ensures the assistant can handle both specific and vague queries efficiently, delivering accurate and contextually relevant responses.
