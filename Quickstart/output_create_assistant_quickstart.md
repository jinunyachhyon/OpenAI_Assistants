assistant > Certainly, Jane Doe! To solve the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\), we need to isolate the variable \(x\). Here are the steps:

1. Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation to get:
   \[
   3x = 14 - 11
   \]
2. Simplify the right side:
   \[
   3x = 3
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{3}{3}
   \]
4. Simplify the right side:
   \[
   x = 1
   \]
